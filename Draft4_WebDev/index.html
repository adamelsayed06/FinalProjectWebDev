        In this guide I will walk you through a fundamental concept in programming: API's. In this documentation we'll be using Javascript as our language of choice due to it's widespread use in the tech industry. 
        We will additionally be covering higher order concepts that are language agnostic, meaning you won't need to understand any specific programming language to understand it. These concepts will include different
        forms of APIs and the way they're used in the real world. You probably interact with these APIs everyday without even knowing it. This guide will hopefully help you develop a deeper appreciation for these tools,
        and give you the ability to to create some beginner level projects using APIs!
